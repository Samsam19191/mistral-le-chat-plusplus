# Contributing Guidelines

## Branching
- Create feature branches from an up-to-date `main` (e.g., `feat/...`, `fix/...`, `chore/...`).
- Never push directly to `main`.

## Commits
- Follow Conventional Commits.
- Keep each commit focused, referencing related issues when helpful.

## Pull Requests
- Describe the change and its motivation.
- Ensure CI passes before requesting review.
- Include tests or clearly explain why tests are not required.

## Local Dev Checklist
1. Install dependencies.
2. Run relevant tests (and linting if available).
3. Update documentation when needed.
4. Open the PR once checks pass.
